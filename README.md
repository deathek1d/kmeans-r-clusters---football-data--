Football Player Performance Analysis
This project explores football player performance data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering to identify distinct player profiles. It visualizes outfield player statistics with interactive Plotly charts and is implemented as a Streamlit app—ideal for portfolio demonstrations of data analysis, clustering, and interactive visualization.

📊 Visualizations

1️⃣ PCA Scatter Plot
Shows players projected into two principal components, colored by cluster.
Observations:
Clusters 4 & 6: Main bulk of outfield players
Clusters 2, 3 & 5: Smaller, specialized roles
PC1: Largest variance, driven by Gper, Aper, Bper
PC2: Smaller variance, influenced by defensive and passing stats

2️⃣ Cluster Sizes
Bar chart displaying the number of players in each cluster
Observations:
Cluster 4: Largest (~145 players) → “average” outfield player
Clusters 2 & 3: Small groups → niche roles

3️⃣ Radar Charts
Normalized cluster profiles for fair comparison
Cluster Profiles:
Cluster 0: Low PC1 & PC2 → support/defensive role players
Cluster 1: High PC1, low PC2 → attacking/goal-oriented players
Cluster 2: Low PC1, slightly positive PC2 → consistent midfield/defensive support
Cluster 3: Negative PC1, high PC2 → creative midfielders or ball-winning players
Cluster 4: PC1 ~0–2, PC2 ~0–5 → all-round midfielders
Cluster 5: Positive PC1, near-zero PC2 → attacking players or wingers
Cluster 6: High PC1, slightly negative PC2 → star forwards or high-impact attackers

4️⃣ PCA Feature Loadings
PC1: Dominated by attacking output (Gper, Aper, Bper)
PC2: Separates defensive vs possession-oriented players (Tper negatively, passes positively)
